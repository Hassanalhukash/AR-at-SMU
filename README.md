# AR-at-SMU
Our objective for this project is to build an augmented reality application for smartphone users so that it increases the interest level of Saint Martinâ€™s University visitors and increase the level of student/staff engagement around campus. The goals for our project is to build a bug free Android application that users can enjoy. Our application scans QR-codes and changes them into an image instantly. The users will use the camera on their smartphones and scan the QR-codes we provided to see through their screens that the QR-code changes to an image or video.
